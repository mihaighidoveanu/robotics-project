# Libraries used

All libraries used were found in the zip file with Robin's code, in Windows format. In this repo you will find present only NAOH25, as it's only a selection of the original library and it might have been modified. The others were too heavy weight to put on github. You can check out the zip file, maybe the files there help you install the libraries on Windows.
